# what
This is a concept of an extension that 
- detects JSON-LD embedded in a website
- generates a consent receipt based on the JSON-LD information (+download)

The JSON-LD schema, and the overall architecture, is being developed at https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/WGISI/CRWeb%3A+Consent+Receipts+for+the+Web. The one in receipt.html is only for testing purposes.

# test
A test website is in receipt.html.
Simply install (as a dev) the extension on your FF/Chrome. For FF, go to "about:debugging", "This firefox", "Load temporary add-on"

# todo
- store the receipts, either locally or remotely
- enrich the information displayed by the extension with external verifications (such as identity of Data Controller)

(lots more! This is just a concept.)
